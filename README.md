Regression and Classification Machine Learning Projects using Python

Both the projects involves data exploration, feature engineering and feature transformation using Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn library in Python

Applied following Classification models using Scikit-Learn library in Python
- KNN, 
- Decision Tree
- Logistic
- SVM (Linear and Kernelized) 

Used F1 score and AUC as comparison between various models

Applied following Regression models using Scikit-Learn library in Python
- Linear
- Polynomial
- Lasso
- Ridge
- KNN regression
- SVM (Linear and Kernelized)

Used RMSE as evaluation technique for comparing various model performance
